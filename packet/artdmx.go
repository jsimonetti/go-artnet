// ArtDMXPacket contains an ArtDMX Packet.
//
// ArtDmx is the data packet used to transfer DMX512 data. The format is identical for
// Node to Controller, Node to Node and Controller to Node.
// The Data is output through the DMX O/P port corresponding to the Universe setting. In
// the absence of received ArtDmx packets, each DMX O/P port re-transmits the same
// frame continuously.
// The first complete DMX frame received at each input port is placed in an ArtDmx packet
// as above and transmitted as an ArtDmx packet containing the relevant Universe
// parameter. Each subsequent DMX frame containing new data (different length or
// different contents) is also transmitted as an ArtDmx packet.
// Nodes do not transmit ArtDmx for DMX512 inputs that have not received data since
// power on.
// However, an input that is active but not changing, will re-transmit the last valid ArtDmx
// packet at approximately 4-second intervals. (Note. In order to converge the needs of Art-Net
// and sACN it is recommended that Art-Net devices actually use a re-transmit time of
// 800mS to 1000mS).
// A DMX input that fails will not continue to transmit ArtDmx data.
//
// Packet Strategy:
//  Controller -  Receive:            Application Specific
//                Unicast Transmit:   Yes
//                Broadcast Transmit: No
//  Node -        Receive:            Application Specific
//                Unicast Transmit:   Yes
//                Broadcast Transmit: No
//  MediaServer - Receive:            Application Specific
//                Unicast Transmit:   Yes
//                Broadcast Transmit: No
